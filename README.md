# TicTacToe
This is a standalone HTML file for playing Two Player TicTacToe.

How To Play
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Player X always goes first, followed by Player O.
The aim of the game is to match 3 of your character (Either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

On your turn, click the box you wish to place your character in. This will automatically fill the box with your character (Assuming the box is empty).

Once you have matched 3 in a row, or all boxes have been filled and neither player has won, the game will end. The game can handle draw states, lose states and win states.

When the game is over, press the reset button to reset the grid and play again!
